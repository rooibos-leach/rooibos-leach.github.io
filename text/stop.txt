I went to my local pub for a mid-afternoon pint and when I arrived, it was filled,
floor-to-ceiling, with a new beer mat. They were all identical clones of this one.
It got me started with my favourite activity: thinking. 

How can it be that the correct procedure for preventing sexual assault has such an
apt and easy acronym? I shudder to think what state the world would be in if not. 
We would be paralysed, struggling to recall a seemingly arbitrary string of 
characters. There are in fact an infinite amount of possible strings, yet it was
STOP that it turned out. That makes the probability 0. 

Unless, of course, it was designed this way. My eyes slid down to the bottom left
corner of the mat - or rather the top right, for I was holding it upside-down - 
and I saw it was issued by His Majesty's Government. This was no coincidence (for 
there is a 0 chance of that). This was designed. His Majesty, King Charles III,
designed sexual assault, carefully crafting it so that it has this neat, beer 
mat-sized solution.

Why? I couldn't say. Perhaps I've said too much already. But if you have any
further intelligence on this matter, don't hesitate to contact me. I am listening.
